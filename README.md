# mobile-flashcards
A mobile application (Android or iOS - or both) that allows users to study collections of flashcards. The app will allow users to create different categories of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards to those decks, then take quizzes on those decks.
It uses React Native, Expo, Redux, & React Navigation.

This app is the third of three projects required for Udacity's React Nanodegree program.
